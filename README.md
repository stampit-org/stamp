## Development

### Install

Run `npm install` as usual followed by `npm run bootstrap` which creates local references to modules that require each other.

### Tests

The `npm test` will execute [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) tests, and then [JSHint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint).

The `jest --watch` will watch file changes and execute tests as needed.
